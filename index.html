            <h3> Phonemes and Study of language  </h3>

            <p class="text">
              As a major player in automatic speech to text transcription, we choose to underline the development o
              The idea is to understand how does a language form and then, how the voice recognition technology works?
              <br><br>
              Linguistics is the scientific study of language, including language form, meaning and language in context. There are different fields of analysis:
              <br><br>
              Phonology: is a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in languages. It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages.
              <br>
              Phonetics: on the other hand, comprises the study of the sounds of human speech. It is concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds (as physiological production, acoustic properties or auditory perceptions).
              <br><br>
              Phonetics gives a very specific description of sounds but no sound is unique. The variety of sounds that the human voice is able to produce is infinite.
              <br><br>
              For example the sound [i] is different if it is pronounced by a man or by a woman, and it can also be different from a single person depending on moments (emotion, cold).
              <br><br>
              Phonology’s response is that language does not retain all sound differences, it only retains difference within relevant sounds in the linguistic system, significant variations. There are therefore functions.
              The sound [i] in English complete the same function regardless the speaker or the pronunciation, it corresponds to the phoneme /i/.
              <br><br>
              A phoneme is the smallest unit of speech that can be used to make one word different from another word. In linguistics, we speak of distinctive units of pronunciation. 
              Phonemes are represented by letters between slashes: /a/, /b/,/r/… , under the rule one phoneme = one symbol.
            </p>

            <h2>  Phonological disorder   </h2>
            <p class="text">
              Phonological disorder is a type of speech sound disorder. Speech sound disorders are the inability to correctly form the sounds of words. 
              Speech sound disorders also include articulation disorder, disfluency, and voice disorders.
            
            </p>

            <h3> Causes    </h3>

            <p class="text">
              This disorder is more common in boys.

              The cause of phonological disorders in children is often unknown.
               Close relatives may have had speech and language problems.
